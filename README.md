## Laravel + React + Typescript

- Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

- React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

- TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
